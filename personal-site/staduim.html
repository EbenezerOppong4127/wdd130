                      Ivory Coast, also known as Côte d'Ivoire, is home to several impressive stadiums that play a crucial role in the nation's sporting culture and international events. These stadiums serve as hubs for various sports, including football (soccer), which is immensely popular in the country. Here are some notable stadiums in Ivory Coast. Stadium of Bouaké: (Stade De La Paix) Bouaké, along with Abidjan, served as a host city for the 1984 Africa Cup of Nations. It is located in the central part of the country, 350 km from the economic capital, and 100 km from Yamoussoukro, the political capital.
                      Players country As of my knowledge cutoff date in January 2022, the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) is a prestigious international football (soccer) tournament that showcases the talents of African national teams. The AFCON is organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and takes place every two years. My information is based on events and decisions up to that date, so I do not have details on the specific host country for the 2024 tournament. The selection of a host country for the AFCON is a significant and highly anticipated event in African football.
