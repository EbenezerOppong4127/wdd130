                      Players country As of my knowledge cutoff date in January 2022, the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) is a prestigious international football (soccer) tournament that showcases the talents of African national teams. The AFCON is organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and takes place every two years. My information is based on events and decisions up to that date, so I do not have details on the specific host country for the 2024 tournament. The selection of a host country for the AFCON is a significant and highly anticipated event in African football.
