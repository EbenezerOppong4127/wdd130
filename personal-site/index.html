            <h2>Players country</h2>
            <p>
                As of my knowledge cutoff date in January 2022, the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) is a prestigious international football (soccer) tournament that showcases the talents of African national teams. The AFCON is organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and takes place every two years. My information is based on events and decisions up to that date, so I do not have details on the specific host country for the 2024 tournament.

                The selection of a host country for the AFCON is a significant and highly anticipated event in African football. It involves a competitive bidding process where countries express their interest in hosting the tournament, and the CAF evaluates their proposals. Factors like infrastructure, stadiums, accommodation, and overall readiness play a crucial role in the decision-making process.

                The AFCON is not only a celebration of football but also a platform for African nations to come together and showcase their cultural richness, unity, and sportsmanship. It brings together fans from across the continent and the world, creating an electric atmosphere both in the stadiums and at home.

                The tournament has a rich history of producing footballing legends and memorable moments. It serves as a talent showcase for players who often go on to have successful careers in top European leagues.

This announcement marks a significant moment for both the nation and the African football community. The decision to host AFCON 2024 in Ivory Coast reflects the country's growing prominence in the world of sports and its commitment to hosting major international events.

                Ivory Coast boasts a rich footballing tradition, with a passionate fan base and a history of producing exceptional football talent. The nation's football legacy, coupled with its investment in infrastructure and sports facilities, makes it a fitting host for this prestigious tournament.

                The Ivory Coast government and local organizing committee are expected to work tirelessly to ensure that the event is a resounding success. This will involve the renovation and construction of stadiums, accommodation, transportation networks, and security measures to accommodate teams, officials, and fans from across the African continent and beyond.

                The Africa Cup of Nations not only showcases the talent of African football but also promotes cultural exchange and unity among nations. Ivory Coast's diverse and vibrant culture will undoubtedly shine through, offering a unique and enriching experience for both participants and spectators.
