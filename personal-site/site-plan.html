    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
        The Africa Cup of Nations (French: Coupe d'Afrique des Nations),
        sometimes referred to as the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations for sponsorship reasons,
        or simply AFCON or CAN, is the main international men's association football competition in Africa.
        It is sanctioned by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and was first held in 1957. Since 1968,
        it has been held every two years, switching to odd-numbered years in 2013 and returned back to even-numbered years in 2022.
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
        The field grew to include nine teams for the third ANC in 1962 in Addis Ababa, and for the first time there was a qualification round to determine which four teams would play for the title. Host Ethiopia and reigning champion Egypt received automatic berths, and were joined in the final four by Nigeria and Tunisia. Egypt made its third consecutive final appearance,
        but the Ethiopia team emerged as victors,
        first beating Tunisia and then downing Egypt in extra time.
